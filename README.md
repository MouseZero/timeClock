# timeClock

This is a command line tool to create .csv files of what you do with your time. Almost like a time clock. The program currently will record when and how long you have done something. The time and dates are recorded in excel format once you open a spread sheet you want to convert the first row to a date/time or time format and the second row to a duration format.

## How to use
node index.js ["description of what your doing"] ["type"]

no argument means clock out.
